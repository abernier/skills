## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#5](https://github.com/abernier/skills/pull/5) [`eaac659`](https://github.com/abernier/skills/commit/eaac659d787f4c7d98060fe4052a41d9485d9624) Thanks [@abernier](https://github.com/abernier)! - Ship the performance bench harness — `tracerbench`, `profiler` and the
  `lgtm-perf` runner — as `scripts/` a repo can depend on by git ref, instead of
  each repo carrying its own fork of it.
  
  The scripts now resolve two roots rather than one: the package directory they
  live in, for their siblings, and the repository being measured, for everything
  else. `lgtm-perf.sh` reads its local gate widths from `.claude/bench.json`
  (`thresholds.localTracerbenchMs`, `thresholds.localTracerbenchFrames`) instead
  of hard-coding one repo's.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#3](https://github.com/abernier/skills/pull/3) [`3a10ea8`](https://github.com/abernier/skills/commit/3a10ea8aed2b9f62326d2a1fbebdd039aeb64949) Thanks [@abernier](https://github.com/abernier)! - `branchstat` ships as a reusable workflow. A repo that wants the report on every PR calls `abernier/skills/.github/workflows/branchstat.yml` instead of vendoring `branchstat.sh` and a workflow to drive it — the plugin owns branchstat in CI the way it already owns it in a session. The script is read at the ref the caller pinned, so the workflow and the script it runs are never two versions.
  
  Releases are cut with Changesets and tagged `vX.Y.Z` (plus a moving `vX`), which is what a caller pins.
